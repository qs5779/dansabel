# note that Ansible defines a number of additional tests,
# like "regex()".
# The tests below pass for the moment, but we do not check arity of the arguments,
# nor do we check the type of inputs, so we may want to add additional checks in
# the future.

x: |
  {{ [1,2] | first is string }}

y: |
  {{ [1,2] | first is in([2,3]) }}

z: |
  {{ [1,2] | first is regex("ab") }}
