# This is a test for issues/11:
#
# The regression test in testcases/bad/file-items-11.yml produces this warning:
# WARNING: potentially conflicting modules: {'file', 'items'} at testcases/bad/file-items-11.yml:0 lines 3-10
# but this file has the fix applied, correcting "items" to "with_items" and thus
# should parse correctly:

- name: make some directories
  file:
    type: directory
    dest: "/tmp/directory_{{ item }}"
  with_items:
    - a
    - b
